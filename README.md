# FreshRSS - "Dilberts daily comic" extension

This FreshRSS extension allows you to directly enjoy the [daily Dilbert comic](http://dilbert.com/) within your FreshRSS installation.

To use it, upload the ```xExtension-Dilbert``` directory to the FreshRSS `./extensions` directory on your server and enable it on the extension panel in FreshRSS.

## The Dilbert feed itself

This extension supports both feed addresses:

- the old one at http://feeds.feedburner.com/DilbertDailyStrip
- and the new one at http://feed.dilbert.com/dilbert/daily_strip 

But this extension will ONLY work on new added feed items as it manipulates them while fetching new items.

## Fair use

Please note that they deactivated the images in their RSS feed years ago, I suspect mainly to get more visitors to their website.
So please play fair and visit them on a daily base instead of using this extension ;-) as we all want to keep their feed alive!

## Requirements

This FreshRSS extension uses the PHP extension [DOM](http://php.net/dom) and [XML](http://php.net/xml).

As those are requirements by [FreshRSS](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS) itself, you should be good to go.


## Installation

The first step is to put the extension into your FreshRSS extension directory:
```
cd /var/www/FreshRSS/extensions/
wget https://github.com/kevinpapst/freshrss-dilbert/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv freshrss-youtube-master/xExtension-Dilbert .
rm -rf freshrss-dilbert-master/
```

Then switch to your browser https://localhost/FreshRSS/p/i/?c=extension and activate it.
